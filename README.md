### 👋Hi, I'm Kurtis Pykes
I design, build, and deploy machine learning applications. Currently, I'm a freelancer and I create content to equip machine learning enthusiast with the necessary resources
to fulfill their potential. Outside of work, I enjoy to... 

* ⚽ Play Football with friends
* 🤸 Do calisthenics - I usually train with repititions with or without weight, but I have dabbled in freestyle and static calisthenics
* 📚 Read lots of books - I'm building my own library
* ♟️ Play chess online
* 😅 Interesting Fact: I'm a cult defector
